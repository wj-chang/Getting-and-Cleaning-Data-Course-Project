About R script
"run_analysis.R" performs the following 5 steps:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1.1 Read files
1.1.1 Read training datasets
1.1.2 Read test datasets
1.1.3 Read features
1.1.4 Read activity labels
1.2 Assign variable names
1.3 Merging all datasets into one set
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
2.1 Read column names
2.2 Create vector to define ID, mean, and sd
2.3 Create data subset
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
4.1 Tidy column names
4.2 Label new descriptive column names
4.3 Remove activityType column
5) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
5.1 Averaging each activity and each subject as Tidy Data
5.2 Export tidy data set
